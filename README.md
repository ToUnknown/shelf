This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Shelf MVP

Manual product inventory backed by Convex. The MVP supports adding, editing, and deleting products in a shared list.

### Convex setup

1. Start Convex locally:
  ```bash
  npx convex dev
  ```
2. Copy the generated `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` into `.env.local`.

For Vercel, the build command injects `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` during deploy.

### Vercel deploy

The build command in `vercel.json` runs `npx convex deploy` and injects the deployment URL
into `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`. Add `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` as a Vercel environment variable
so the deploy can authenticate.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
